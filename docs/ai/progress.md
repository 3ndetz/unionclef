## Current playthrough status

- Goal remains a complete natural `@gamer` playthrough, with visual observation and regression tests.
- Original one-high opening/low-ceiling ascent defect was fixed in the planner and final walker arrival. Latest audit: one_high 2/2, three head blocks planned and mined, grounded arrival, 20 HP. Flat/staircase/descend 3/3, no invalid runs.
- HEAD before this pass: 828f5a81, including iron-smelting fix 82d5d50e and documentation-only upstream fe28b686. Smelting matrix 6/6: missing output is produced; already-satisfied output leaves raw iron untouched. All videos decoded. No whole-game success claim.
- Natural survival-smelt-fixed reached a water bucket and descended to y28 for gold, but food collection preempted gold mining. No gold appeared in sampled inventory; an earlier commentary saying it had been mined was corrected. Both picks wore out; replacement iron pick was crafted after a temporary placement delay. Then the bot dug a staircase toward surface pigs, reaching y96 with 20 HP in all recorded samples.
- This run ended in a client crash at 17:55:13 UTC. Observer session44767 exited1; last sample707s at120.3,96,-148.3. Container automatically restarted, and the natural world is now disconnected. Do not report later progress from this stale JSON.
- Verified natural world backup before that run: workspace outputs/natural-checkpoints/20260915-173341-iron-kit.tar.gz, 56,062,872 bytes, SHA256 metadata adjacent. No inventory injection or world restoration.
- Open risks: general multi-mob/Enderman/skeleton survival, long surface food hunts from caves, waterfall partial-route termination, coasting/slab arrival, azalea pillar placement. Shield combat experiments failed and were reverted; their complete patch remains in workspace work/shield-combat-experiment.patch. Nether/End/full completion remain unvalidated.
- Push and Telegram publication remain blocked pending previously requested target-specific confirmation. No retry or alternate route.

## 2026-09-15 — Publish navigator results on the client thread

### Investigate
- Crash report: `BlockPathWalker.tickBFS` line523 reads path.size after the route was nulled concurrently. Docker events show normal container exit0/restart, not an OOM event. The application emitted a fatal exception first.
- The same-second log shows FastNavigator-plan entering “walking dead-ends (61.0 -> 58.0) -> physics owns the rest”, while Render thread starts a two-waypoint walk. That worker branch calls BlockPathWalker.stop directly.
- Full plan-result handling currently writes several navigator fields and rendering plans from the worker. It only checks active, so a result from an old route can also publish after stop/start reactivates the navigator. Baritone PathingBehavior serializes calculation publication and path ticks with pathPlanLock.
- Controlled old-jar reproduction: pause the client at a bounded barrier, start a short enclosed corridor route, wait for the actual worker to finish. The walker became inactive and the physics handoff counter increased1 while the client remained paused. This demonstrates the cross-thread mutation without crashing the client. First probe attempt had a Vec3d argument-type error and is not a pass.
- Artifacts: workspace outputs/walker-publication/baseline-probe.json and natural-crash.txt. All six natural run clips decoded.

### Plan
- Keep calculation on the worker; apply the complete result on the client thread so handoffs cannot interrupt a walker tick.
- Identify each calculation with a generation invalidated by cancellation. Discard queued stale results without clearing a newer calculation's planning flag.
- Validate real worker completion while the client is paused, then application after release. Retarget while old publication is queued and require its rejection. Repeat, then broad navigation/mining/placement and original one-high regression before resuming the natural world.

### Implement
- FastNavigator result handling extracted unchanged into applyPlan; worker queues publication through MinecraftClient.execute. Generation and world checks reject stale results. Applied/discarded counters are read by the new fixture. No extra null check in BlockPathWalker masks the race.
- New walker_publication_test uses a client barrier with a ten-second automatic timeout, a real short partial plan, and optional retarget. Fixture setup and restoration are bounded; it does not require a spontaneous crash to validate the handoff.
- Tungsten clean build and deployment succeeded; fixed-fixture and adjacent results are recorded below.

- First fixed publication test passed: no handoff while the client was paused, one applied handoff after release. Retarget test publication-2 FAILED: the old result was discarded, but stop() had never cleared planning, so start() could not launch the replacement and the stale result no longer cleared it. Added planning=false to cancellation; generation checks keep old completions from clearing newer work. This was a real implementation failure, not a fixture mismatch. Clean rebuild/deploy succeeded; the corrected matrix is recorded below. Final natural clip6 decoded successfully.

- Corrected binary passed 6/6 controlled publications: three ordinary handoffs and three retargets. All kept the walker active and handoff/application counters unchanged while the client was paused; each applied a real handoff after release. Retargets additionally discarded the queued old calculation. All six videos decoded. The broader navigation audit and matched follow-up are recorded below.


### Adjacent audit and newly isolated work
- The initial full nav audit was interrupted during nav_cliff after flat/staircase/descend passed. Steep failed twice at the same lip; gaps fell twice in each of the initial and refreshed runs. All five completed course videos decoded; the interrupted cliff recording was saved separately.
- A clean HEAD828f5a81 baseline and restored publication build were both run through flat, staircase, steep, gaps in the same order. Both passed flat/staircase/gaps and failed steep twice at (6.683,-60,0.5). Baseline gaps had no falls at23.2FPS; restored gaps had no falls at27.6FPS. Earlier publication-build falls remain recorded. No fall-rate improvement or regression is established; some flat/staircase FPS differed, so no timing comparison is claimed.
- Baseline build/deploy logs: /private/tmp/publication-baseline-{build,deploy}.log. Restored publication build/deploy: /private/tmp/publication-restored-{build,deploy}.log. Both clean builds and nested-jar checks succeeded. Current source and deployed binary contain the publication fix again.
- NavCliff had an invalid approach: its start pad stood four blocks below its first platform, without building materials. The fixture now derives both surfaces from start_y; a geometry check confirms both at y-49 and feet at y-48. Live corrected-course audit passed:21.2s,29FPS,20HP,no falls or freezes.
- Harness reporting incorrectly called an arena fall at26FPS a below14FPS result. Added invalid_reason, preserved the arena reason, and removed unsupported load/wear attribution from retries and summary. Replayed the production judging/reporting block with recorded fall samples, low-FPS samples, and an ordinary healthy failure: all three reported the appropriate cause.
- Next root cause, not yet fixed: FastNavigator returns immediately for every result shorter than two waypoints, including an incomplete dead end. Real client-thread FastPlanner.plan at nav_steep's (6,-60,0) toward (22,-54,0) returns one waypoint, complete=false, no physics flag. A bounded worker fixture with a one-cell corridor also applies that result (applied292→293) without any handoff. This differs from a complete one-cell answer where the goal is already satisfied. Fixture now supports --one-cell and --goal-here controls. The short-incomplete fix is pending; do not claim steep repaired.


### Publication fix accepted locally
- Original one-high ascent audit passed2/2, with all three head blocks planned/mined and grounded arrival at20HP. The video decoded and was visually inspected and shown locally.
- Hungry mining ambush passed:6 cobblestone,20HP throughout,145 mining samples,zero sword interruptions during continuous mining. Threat/target entities were gone; video decoded and final image inspected.
- Completed one-cell control applies the result without physics handoff, as required. Incomplete one-cell baseline and retarget controls both reproduce the missing handoff after successful result publication. These follow-up tests establish an existing bug; they are not a claim that it is repaired.
- All matched-prefix videos and the corrected-cliff video decoded. Harness-only fixes committed as58f9254e. The publication race fix is ready for a separate local commit, followed immediately by the short-incomplete-result pass. Full-game completion and general parkour reliability remain open.
